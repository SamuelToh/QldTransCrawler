# QldTransCrawler
This script periodically polls the Queensland transport's web services for a desire practical test dates for driving and send email to a nominated email address if a suitable test date is found.
Please note, this script is not meant to be used as a tool to stir trouble for the Queensland transport's web services.
If you are intending to use it as a weapon, please think twice as Qld transport reserve rights to lodge a police report against you.

## Code Example
Coming soon.

## Motivation
Wife needed to learn driving and we are sick and tired of refreshing the test date page to look for an appropriate date. Hence the creation of this script.

## Installation
requirements.txt is coming soon.

## Tests
No test. Just a hack script I put together.
